## Summary
**GDP vs Unemployment rate. ("How does a country's GDP affect the Unemployment rate and what are the other Causes of Unemployment?")**      
-	This project goal is to analyze Okun's Law and find the relationship between a country's GDP and its unemployment rate, my analysis Confirmed that Okun's Law generally holds, with a 1% reduction in unemployment requiring approximately 4% GDP growth for a year.      
-	I also identified exceptions to Okun's Law, such as during the 2008 recession in the United States.      
-	To conduct this study, I collected data from the World Bank and analyzed the data, ensuring the accuracy of our analysis. Additionally, I identified and examined other influential factors that contribute to changes in the unemployment rate. By utilizing data visualization techniques, such as Seaborn & Plotly in Python.   

**Financial Risk Analysis of Foreign Market Using CAPM and Fama French 3 Factor Model.**     
-	In this project, I focused on analyzing the risk associated with investing in foreign stock markets. Specifically, I explored the limitations of the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) and discussed how the FAMA French 3 Factor Model (FF3F) is a better alternative.    
-	My analysis revealed that CAPM is generating inaccurate forecasts due to its reliance on a single factor - market risk. In contrast, the FF3F model incorporates additional factors such as size and value, which provide a more accurate forecast. By using FF3F, we were able to make more informed investment decisions resulting in a 15% increase in portfolio returns.    

**Airline Revenue Forecasting Using the Univariate Time Series.**          
-	In this project. Using time series models, I predicted and forecasted the revenue of major US airlines. I applied five univariate time series models to the data and, with the help of statistical tests, determined that the SARIMA model was the most precise at predicting and forecasting the trend due to seasonality.    
-	This project has demonstrated that time series models, specifically SARIMA, can help identify future revenue with better accuracy. As a result, this will aid airline industries in making better decisions and ultimately improve overall revenue.      

**Edge Computing: Computer Vision – Image Classification identifying the type of lung diseases.**        
-	Developed a computer vision application utilizing edge computing techniques to perform image classification for the identification of various types of lung diseases.      
-	Leveraged Machine learning algorithms to analyze medical images, such as X-rays and CT scans, for accurate disease detection.      
-	Implemented the project to run on edge devices such as Jetson Nano, ensuring real-time and efficient processing without relying on cloud infrastructure.      

**Speech Emotion recognition.**        
-	In this project using machine learning I developed a model to recognize human emotion and affective state through speech patterns. the speech often conveys underlying emotions through changes in pitch and tone. 
-	Employed feature engineering techniques such as MFCC (Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients) and Mel spectrogram extraction and pitch analysis to effectively capture and represent the subtle nuances in speech patterns related to different emotional states.      
-	Conducted rigorous model evaluation and fine-tuning, achieving a high accuracy rate of 87% in classifying diverse emotions, including but not limited to happiness, sadness, anger, and neutral states, thus demonstrating the robustness and generalizability of the developed emotion recognition system.      

**Lungs Sound Classification.**
- During my internship at Sonavi Labs, I worked on an exciting project that aimed to classify breathing sounds. The primary focus of my project was to distinguish between wheezes and crackles in breathing sounds accurately.    
- To achieve this, I began by meticulously processing the data. I started by cleaning the audio and removing any artifacts that could interfere with the sound classification process. I also separated breathing and heartbeat sounds to ensure that the classification was accurate.      
- Next, I employed various modeling techniques to classify the sounds accurately. These techniques included using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), decision trees, and random forests. Each model was evaluated based on its accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.      
- After testing several models, I was able to achieve an accuracy of 82% in sound classification. However, I did not stop there. To improve the robustness of the model, I implemented data augmentation techniques. This involved creating new samples by adding background noise, changing the pitch, and adding echo effects to the existing sound samples.      
- Throughout the project, I used Azure ML Studio to conduct the entire process. This platform provided me with all the necessary tools to build, test, and deploy my models. Overall, this project was a great learning experience, and I am proud of the results I was able to achieve.
