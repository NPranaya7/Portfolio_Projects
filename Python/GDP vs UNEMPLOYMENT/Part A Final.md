### Intoduction:
Unemployment is When a person is ready to work but unable to secure a job. Mainly unemployment is caused by the three factors 
- Structural - Structural Unemployment Happen when the required skillset is not matched for the job demanded or when a worker is having a job but not able to attend the work place due to technical issues.
- Frictional - Frictinoal unemployment is happen when a person is looking for a job change or in between the jobs.
- Cyclical - Cyclical Unemployment Happens when the Economy faces recession in other words when economy crashes. during this time Unemployment rate will increases.  

In this project we are looking at Okun's Law regarding Unemployment rate. Okun's Law state that their is a relationship between a countryâ€™s unemployment and economic growth rates.
According to Okun's law, a country's gross domestic product (GDP) must expand at a pace of around 4% for one year in order to achieve a 1% reduction in unemployment.But their are 
some time where Okun's Law proved wrong especially during Americas 2008 recession. this project aim is to analysis the data from world bank using world development explorer tool to 
find how accurate is okun's law.

The relationship between economic growth and the unemployment rate may be wobbly in the short term. It's not uncommon for the unemployment rate to continue to fall after other broad indicators of economic activity have improved. As a result, it is known as a lagging economic indicator. Some organizations may have inefficient personnel on their payrolls since dismissing off workers when product demand decreases and rehiring them when product demand increases has costs. This is one reason why unemployment may not fall significantly when economic growth picks up after a recession ends. As a consequence, firms may be able to boost output to meet increased demand without recruiting new workers at the start of a comeback.

Overall, Okun's rule is widely regarded as one of the most basic and practical approaches to studying the link between economic growth and unemployment rate. One of the main advantages of Okun's rule is its simplicity in saying that if the economy expands at a rate of 2% higher than anticipated, unemployment would fall by 1%. However, depending on it to create particular unemployment projections based on economic growth trends does not work very well. For example, it has been found to fluctuate over time and be influenced by more uncommon economic conditions, such as jobless recoveries and the 2008 financial crisis, since it was first researched.
Analysis may get quite complex due to the complexity of the inputs, the many time periods that can be employed, and the inherent uncertainty that comes with performing economic regressions. Okun's rule may not be completely accurate, but it can assist frame discussions about economic growth and how unemployment affects it.

## Conclusion:
- From the Scatter plot We now Understand that As the GDP progress the Unemployment is reducing in the Country 
- but althought GDP and Unemployment Rate correlates but few time it Varies like during recision in 2008 at that time as the GDP progress the unemployement is also Incresed in united states and united kingdom
- so that many scientist and analysts and economists  argue that it is a inverse relationship between the GDP and Unemployment rate
- in my opinion the unemployment is related to GDP but as well as other factors also that causes the unemployment rate to increses or decreses.
