In this project, we focused on analyzing the risk associated with investing in foreign stock markets. Specifically, we explored the limitations of the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) and discussed how the FAMA French 3 Factor Model (FF3F) is a better alternative.

Our analysis revealed that CAPM is generating inaccurate forecasts due to its reliance on a single factor - market risk - to explain returns. This limitation fails to capture the complexity of the market and leads to incorrect predictions.

In contrast, the FF3F model incorporates additional factors such as size and value, which provide a more complete picture of the market and lead to more accurate forecasts. By using FF3F, we were able to improve our risk analysis and make more informed investment decisions.

Overall, our project has been a success. We have gained a deeper understanding of the limitations of CAPM and the benefits of FF3F. Going forward, we plan to continue using FF3F in our risk analysis and explore other alternative models to further improve our investment strategies.
