I had the opportunity to work on a fascinating project focused on classifying breathing sounds with the primary goal of accurately distinguishing between wheezes and crackles. This project was critical for enhancing diagnostic tools and improving patient outcomes.
The project began with meticulous data preprocessing, where I cleaned the audio recordings to eliminate any artifacts that could interfere with the classification process. I also developed methods to isolate breathing sounds from other background noises, such as heartbeat sounds, to ensure precise sound classification.
For the classification task, I implemented a variety of machine learning models, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), decision trees, and random forests. Each model was rigorously evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to identify the most effective approach. After testing multiple models, I achieved an accuracy of 82% in classifying the breathing sounds. However, I aimed for even greater reliability in real-world applications.
To enhance the model's robustness, I implemented data augmentation techniques. This involved generating new training samples by introducing controlled variations such as background noise, pitch shifts, and echo effects. These augmentations not only improved model generalization but also ensured the model’s performance across diverse scenarios.
Throughout this project, I utilized Azure ML Studio, which provided a comprehensive environment for building, testing, and deploying my models seamlessly. This platform’s integrated tools streamlined the entire process, from data preparation to model deployment.
This project was a significant learning experience, allowing me to refine my skills in audio preprocessing, deep learning, and cloud-based model deployment. I’m proud of the results we achieved and the positive impact this work can have on healthcare diagnostics.
